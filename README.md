# About

A practice repo with 
- [TDD ping pong](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/ping-pong-programming/)
- [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/)
- [Network interception with Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)

# Why mock an API?
- Real requests can cost money
- Requests can be resource intensive
- Requests can be slow 
- Testing is now dependent on something external.
